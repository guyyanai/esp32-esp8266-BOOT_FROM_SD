# ESP32, ESP8266 SD/micro SD boot library <br />

Hello everyone, <br />
I've made this library for anyone who wants to boot his/her esp32/esp8266 from SD/micro SD card and select the specific .bin (compiled Arduino sketch) which the esp will flash itself with and boot from after automatic restart. <br />
Good luck and Happy Coding. <br />
